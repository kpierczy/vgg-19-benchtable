# @brief      Script gathers all functionalities of impl/* scripts. Configuration variables, defined under this header, 
#             should be set appropriately before running. After running the script the whole environment for working with
#             the project will be prepared. Lacking tools and python packages will be installed and the environment variables
#             will be set. Console used to source this script will be ready to use project's python scripts.
#                 
#             In cases when a CPU/Nvidia GPU is used, the console sourcing the script will be switched to the python virtual
#             environment. Thanks to it, the user space will be not cluttered with additional python packages required by the
#             project.
#                 
#             In case of AMD GPU, the script will run a docker container with a fully-isolated environment used to play
#             with project's code. The virtual machine will have the project's folder mounted and the user will be 
#             automatically switched to it so that they can instantly run the training. 
#    
# @note Read 'config/kaggle/README.md' before sourcing this file
#
# @note You should 'source' this script instead of executing. For future compatibility source it from the project's home directory.
#
# @warning Sourcing this script will install lacking tools with sudo, without asking user at the every  installation. Before sourcing
#    the script, read content of the scripts/impl/*.bash files or source this script in an isolated environment.
#
# @note The script assumes that `python3` will be used to run project's code and all python packages are#     installed using 
#   `python3 -m pip install`
#
# @note In case of AMD workflow, the virtual machine is run only when script is sourced with the 'run' argument.
